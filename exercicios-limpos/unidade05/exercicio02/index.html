                Lorem ipsum is placeholder text commonly 
                used in the graphic, print, and 
                publishing industries for previewing 
                layouts and visual mockups.

            <h2>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
                consectetur adipiscing elit, 
                sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt 
                ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
            </h2>
        </hgroup>

        <p>The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create 
            a natural looking block of text 
            (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) 
            that doesn't distract from the layout. 
            A practice not without controversy, laying out 
            pages with meaningless filler text can be very 
            useful when the focus is meant to be on design, 
            not content.</p>

        <p>
            The placeholder text, beginning 
            with the line “Lorem ipsum dolor
             sit amet, consectetur adipiscing 
             elit”, looks like Latin because 
             in its youth, centuries ago, it was Latin.
